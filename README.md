- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Research Directions for Verifiable Crypto-Physically Secure TEEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03183)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hardware security[^1] and open source hardware[^2]
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source hardware projects for secure chips
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with transitioning from software to hardware
- 🧑‍🏫 Teach me about PUFs, physical one-way functions and black holes
- 💬 Ask me about PUFs, physical one-way functions and black holes

## More on secure hardware
Talk: [qtee: Moving Towards Open Source & Verifiable Secure-through-Physics TEE Chips - Sylvain Bellemare](https://youtu.be/j6pGxMfffdA?si=rJEeSZcpyf6q10TG), given at [TEE.salon @ EthCC Brussels](https://lu.ma/tee.salon), hosted by Flashbots.

The talk was much appreciated by those who attended (e.g. https://x.com/buchmanster/status/1811386013689778315).
